# ISSUES MOVED TO NEW REPOSITORY

Please do not file new issues in this repository. All RECAP-related issues should be filed at:

https://github.com/freelawproject/recap/issues/new/

Sorry for the confusion. The backstory is that we want all of our RECAP issues under the same roof, not spread around to the Firefox or Chrome or other repository. (This was a bigger issue before Firefox adopted Chrome's extension model, but we're still stuck with it really.)
