##SAFARI Extension iOS, iPadOS, macOS

-----------------------------------


### Quick Start 

--------
Anyone knew to this should read this page.

This code is based on the [safari-extension-template](
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/converting_a_web_extension_for_safari
)

Apple supplies an xcode tool to generate iOS and macOS extensions from chrome/firefox extensions. 
Running build-safari.py should generate a directory 

- recap 
   - iOS (App)
   - iOS (Extension)
   - macOS (App)
   - iOS (Extension)
   - recap.xcodeproj
   - Shared (App)
   - Shared (Extension)
  
### Notes

----------

In theory this should generate a series of recap extensions that work on apple 
platforms. This is indeed how we generated version in previous iterations
but since WWDC something appear to have changed.
