##SAFARI Extension iOS, iPadOS, macOS

-----------------------------------


### Notes 

Anyone knew to this should read this page.

This code is based on the [safari-extension-template](
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/converting_a_web_extension_for_safari
)

### Quick Start

cd into the safari directory and run the following command:

    python build-safari.py

This will create two new directories for iOS (and iPadOS) and macOS.
Each of these directories will contain a new extension and XCode project.
